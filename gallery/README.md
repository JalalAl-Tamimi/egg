Gallery of electroglottographic signals
=============

The diversity of electroglottographic signals is impressive. States of the glottis can change rapidly: signals for the same speaker are highly diverse. There is diversity across phonological categories, diversity among speaking styles, diversity along the lifespan, and of course there are differences across speakers. 

The gallery presented here aims to provide a basis for a classification of phonation types. The idea is to identify some _types_, and relate them to the various classifications proposed in the literature. Emphasis is laid on quantified criteria, which allow for the automatic detection of these types. This is expected to facilitate discussion of phonation types among phoneticians. 

The work is now (2019) in its initial stage, with _glottalization_ as a first area of investigation.

## Types of glottalization: glottal constriction, creaky voice/vocal fry, irregular phonation...

> The term “creaky voice” (or “creak”, used here
> interchangeably) refers to a number of different
> kinds of voice production. (Keating et al. 2015)

### 1. Constricted creak

egg: tools for electroglottographic analysis
=============

This repository will be used in 2019 to host Matlab scripts for analysis of the electroglottographic signal:

* an improved version of peakdet, under development. The earlier (stable) version is in the COVAREP repository: https://github.com/covarep/covarep/tree/master/glottalsource/egg

* new scripts for the detection and characterization of various phonetic subtypes of glottalization.

(If you use Praat, not Matlab, you can use James Kirby's *praatdet* https://github.com/kirbyj/praatdet or CÃ©dric Gendrot's *oq1praat*, available here: http://voiceresearch.free.fr/egg/#downloads

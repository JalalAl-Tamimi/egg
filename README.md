EGG: tools for electroglottographic analysis
=============

This repository will be used in 2019 to host Matlab scripts for analysis of the electroglottographic signal. 

## a script for visualizing average curves for sets of tokens: *aver*
See [this folder](https://github.com/alexis-michaud/egg/tree/master/aver). 

## Coming soon: an improved version of the main analysis script: *peakdet*

This version is under development. The earlier (stable) version is in the COVAREP repository: https://github.com/covarep/covarep/tree/master/glottalsource/egg

## Coming soon: new scripts for the detection and characterization of various phonetic subtypes of glottalization.

(If you use Praat, not Matlab, you can use James Kirby's [*praatdet*](https://github.com/kirbyj/praatdet) or CÃ©dric Gendrot's [*oq1praat*](http://voiceresearch.free.fr/egg/#downloads).)

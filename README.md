EGG: tools for electroglottographic analysis
=============

This repository hosts Matlab scripts for analysis of the electroglottographic signal, and data samples.  

## a script for visualizing average curves for sets of tokens: *aver*
See [this folder](https://github.com/alexis-michaud/egg/tree/master/aver). 

## a gallery of signals exemplifying different types of glottalization (work in progress)
See [this folder](gallery). This strand of work is linked to the project of devising new scripts for the detection and characterization of various phonetic subtypes of glottalization.

## _Coming soon: an improved interface for the main analysis script, `peakdet`_

I find it useful to be able to do the analysis semi-automatically, with visual verification of the results token by token. To comply with the standards of the COVAREP repository, the version of `peakdet` [hosted in COVAREP](https://github.com/covarep/covarep/tree/master/glottalsource/egg) is the core function, without a user interface for data verification. The interface available [here](http://voiceresearch.free.fr/egg/softwares.htm#peakdet) still works, but I plan to work on improvements in 2019.

## A note to Praat users
Praat users can turn to James Kirby's [`praatdet`](https://github.com/kirbyj/praatdet) or CÃ©dric Gendrot's [`oq1praat`](http://voiceresearch.free.fr/egg/#downloads).

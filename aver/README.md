aver: averaging over n tokens of a given tone
=============

In the study of linguistic tone, it is common practice to record several tokens of the same lexical tone. The **aver** script was written to allow phoneticians to visualize an *average* curve for these sets of tokens.

The average curves are plotted against average duration, not over abstract steps (e.g. steps of 10% of total duration) which in effect normalize the duration. Thus, if several tone categories are plotted on the same figure, differences in duration can be visualized. As an example, the figure below (from the [*Proceedings of ICPhS 2015*](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01148765/document)) brings out average durational differences between the High, Mid and Low tones of the Naxi language.

peakdet_inter: a version of <peakdet> with interface for user verification
=============

<peakdet> is a script for the semi-automatic analysis of the electroglottographic signal.

A version of <peakdet> is hosted [in the COVAREP repository](https://github.com/covarep/covarep/tree/master/glottalsource/egg/peakdet). Following
COVAREP's principles, that version is written as a function taking a
signal as input, without a user interface. 
 
The present version, by contrast, takes as input a list of regions to analyze
and incorporates a (simple) display for verification of the results by the user. 
This script is called <peakdet_inter>, where 'inter' stands for 'interface'.
